# Techniques

Adds fields to the tender and lot objects to describe the use of techniques, such as framework agreements, dynamic purchasing systems and electronic auctions.

## Guidance

### Framework agreement's `value` and `period`

The `value` and `period` fields of the `FrameworkAgreement` object should only be used if the procurement process has more than one framework agreement and if each data source provides this information for **each** contract and framework agreement.

### Framework agreement's `method`

Here are the possible value for `FrameworkAgreement.method`, and common synonyms:

- withoutReopeningCompetition: call-offs
- withReopeningCompetition: mini-competitions
- withAndWithoutReopeningCompetition: call-offs and mini-competitions
-
## Legal context

In the European Union, this extension's fields correspond to [eForms BG-706 (Techniques)](https://github.com/eForms/eForms). See [OCDS for the European Union](http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/eu/master/en/) for the correspondences to Tenders Electronic Daily (TED).
